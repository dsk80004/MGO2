whip (Will need to be able to make use of paths, and stretched sprites to path, will need at least 60 paths for the animation... uhhhg)
Divine Spray "spray and pray" (inaccuracy + similar to rewpeater although used for use with card shuffler, flame thrower, cone of fire)
Plumble (when collided with an enemy tapping will cause additional damage, enemy players can dash out, and repeater stacks with this mod)
nega-rang (return TO the projectile) //get a better name for this. its a bit like a hook shot, but probably instant? maybe add the vectors?
Reflective (causes the reflect modifier for ranged shots) (for use with bubble shield style summons, also a massive damper on ranged weapons)
Ray beam (turns the entire projectile into a ray, not really sure what this intails although the words, freeze ray made me think of this one.)
continuous (modcount = dmge tick increased, this will make an AOE continuous, or cause tick based damage, mutliples cause longer time for aoe)
Flail (changes the attacking method into a flail attack, adds attack range but makes it a bit slower.) (multiples will give it a further reach)
Burrow (allows the enemy to burrow underground, modcount = higher resurface distance (can not pop out ontop of a player, but can an other enemy))

mimic (prevent any other mod from activating untill an enemy player is with in striking range, if no enemies are nearby, then stick near your owner) 
Keen (general damage increase, and decapitation increased chance {basicaly just a filler mod for any weapon you have with the mods you already want})

Hidden (Will not be drawn untill an enemy player is with in striking range, if summoned when drawing the owners camera view, make the summon transparent)
Passive (This prevents the default collision damage, and applies damage to health, relative to mod count. For players this is [probably] a worthless mod)
Incinoration (need shader but make a magma texture slowly consume the players model, then replace with ask which drops to a pile, look around for insperations)
Sef Destruct (explodes, dealing half it's remaining health with a max of ___) (if this modifier is mixed with timer, just make it explode at the end of the timer)
blade turn (if colliding with an enemy's weapon buttom mash to see who deals extra damage, this mod does not proc if the enemy is already in the damage dealt list)
Psycho (All mods attempt to do the opposite, so heat seaking would steer away from enemies, guiding would move in the oposite direction of the player's inputs etc)
AutoSwing (This is NOT rapid fire! As long as it's actively equipped it will automatically swing at enemies, if reflect is also on the weapon it wil swing at projectiles too)
moveable (unlocks the ability to move while swinging, although it also allows you to guide which direction you are attacking, the change in direction is effected by mod count)
Greedy (will steal things off the ground, slowing him down and increasing damage, although will prioritize stealing over attacking, drops the last three items it stole on death)
Squirt [maybe better name] (shoots a random volly of 3-5 projectiles, the volly is with in a 90 degree area of desired location, every second when player controlled, longer for normal)
Gibbing (general damage increase, and greatly increase gibbing chance by removing the chance for decap {basicaly just a filler mod for any weapon you have with the mods you already want})
Tractor Beam (make a list of all enemies infront of the weapon, for each enemy allign them slightly closer to the center point of the line, and move them to the player, like the gravity gun)
Chained (spawns in chained to a stake in the ground, after a while it can break free of the chain and moves much faster, modcount = extra damage, 3 or more makes it not able to leave the chain)
Swimming (This will always take last priority, but if the summon is not inside water it will flail around, although if it is, it gets double the movement speed. and a passive default movement mod)
Hive Mind (This should probably be a passive effect, if there are entities >=4 of the same name and owner_id, Then every other frame they only use the leader's movements, or move towards the leader?)
Kinesis (on collision, freeze the player and enemy for a second or so and allow the player to adjust where the knockback will be applied, similar to golf mechanics, or breath of the wilds kinesis effect)
[propultion] shoots out a bunch of short ranged projectiles behind it, rocketing it around the room bouncing off walls dealing collision damage and projectile damage. (mod count = time propultion happens)
Plus beams (+ shaped laser beams coming from the entity, for 1 second, with a cool down of 3 seconds, the entity is unable to move or do anything else durring this time) [modcount also dictates laser beam width]
Cross beams (X shaped laser beams coming from the entity, for 1 second, with a cool down of 3 seconds, the entity is unable to move or do anything else durring this time) [modcount also dictates laser beam width]
Bouncy (when colliding with ground, bounce in a random angle with in a 180 degree cone of where it's headed, number of bounces is relative to mod count, distance gets cut in half each time, and speed drops by 33%)
Welder (similar to repeater although it keeps the weapon spawned, creating new projectiles, although will over heat depending on how many mods it has, although this also means more projectiles come out faster aswell)
Flight, (This is free directional movement, which allows for moving over objects, although it will converge undesired inputs into the desired ones with a sine wave which rocks back and forth from top-left and bottom-right)
Spin attack (basically just spin in circles, in a 1/2 chunk radius, if colliding with a wall, get some extreme knockback in the other direction, also throwing out projectiles 3 a second, inspired by TBoI's Greed mode boss)
Throwable (tapping the attack button will cause for a normal swing although holding it for 0.25 of a second will throw it, holding it for a full second will throw it at max range, and the max range is dictated by weapon range + modcount)
knockback (this is a passive attack which knocks back all entities; modcount 1 = 5 second delay, with a 3 tile knockback; modcount 2 = 2 seconds, 4 tiles; modcount 3 = 1 second, 4 tiles; modcount 4 = 0 second, 4 tiles; modcount 5 = 0 second, 6 tiles;)
Ridable (This allows for the NPC to be mounted, and controlled by the player mounting it. This is very similar to being possessed, although it's not timed, and the player is carried with the AI, The player is also perfectly invulnerable while mounting an AI)
Laser Eye (A directional laser beam coming from the entity, for 1 second, with a cool down of 0 second for the player and 1 second for anything else, the entity is unable to move or do anything else durring this time) [modcount also dictates laser beam width]
Prop (it's a modifier to allow for prop hunt, basically turns you into a prop object for a while, the higher the mod the longer it lasts, 6 is infinate untill death, mechanically speaking this acts more like invisibility, enemy AI simly wont see you if you arent moving) 
Teleport, (This is less of a movement type and more of a movement ability, almost exactly the same as Massive Jump, although the entity goes invisible, and will do it's best to use this effect when a projectile is on a collision course for it, or if the player is out of reach)
Charge (if enemy is with in the direction it is currently moveing dash in that direction untill you collide with something, this is grid based movement only? 1-2 second cool down for player possesion, longer to normal) [movement speeds: 1 chunk in 4 seconds, 2.666, 1.333, 1, 0.5]
Burrow, (can only move while it's underdround, collision is turned off, and it must come back up once every 3 seconds, if it's current location is block either nudge it over 8 pixels, or deal some dagame to it and dont make it come back up then restart the timer, can not attack while under ground)
Inverse Movement, (Will always try to reach the closest possition oposite of the player, although this does give the summon infinate flight, if it is outside, simly try to stay on the edge of the player camera? idk If it is player possesed let it move freely, with the usual restrictions on flight)
Seppuku (small health up. Will intentionally move infront of enemy projectiles preventing them from hitting the player, modcount = movement speed, possibly consider including a cooldown timer where after modcount number of bullets deflected it needs to cool down before attempting to deflect more projectiles)
Minion Production (This allows them to spawn 3-7 extremely basic minions, trying to use this attack after they already have max minions only produces a projectile shot at the desired enemy, this projectile does make use of other ranged based mods) [boss mode makes each projectile into a volly of projectiles instead]
Leaper, (it's actually a lot like airstrike in mechanics, dont move unles given an input, only move while leap is active, other movement mods can either take place before or after, or dynamically change the speed based on if it's in or out of a jump. this one will take some trouble shooting to see what works save it for later)
Continum Charge (the entity dashes from it's current location off the screen, back on from the other side, and lands on it's same location-ish. this attack can only be used left and right, never any other direction) [modcount = number of selves which will dash the screen the second time, of mod count is only 1 then there is no second time]
"Ray Casting", or "ray tracing", or just "tracer" (this has a very very small heat seeking adjustment, although it will skip the step events, and jump dirrectly to collision events, In practice this means that the projectiles will appear to spawn directly on their targets, usefull for a BFG or a cone of electricity type weapon [example: electro gun GTA2])
Neutural (This prevents the default enemy tracking, but if a player deals any damage to this entity it will permanately focus on the first player who dealt damage to it, then then next successive player in queue, this provieds a substantial damage increase for the entity, and the first damage is ignored, but it acts like it was damaged still giving it iframes)
Loot (on death drop items, the items dropped will either be random, or based on the name of the etity, unless it's player summoned then only drop common-uncommon items no matter the mod count) [An entity name like "tree" will only drop apples and wood, where an entity name like "crate" will drop items from the dungeon pool, and "chest" will drop usable items only]
Swarm (makes modcount more of the same spawn with 75% damage, and slight max speed increase) (they should also completely ignore each other's collision, and only the leader dictates which way they move, the rest will cycle through the directional inputs in a counter clockwise direction, and average the direction to the leader, the leaders, inputs*2, and their current spin direction.)
Bouncy, (Moves around the room slowly, bouncing off the walls, if it's an enemy it will always start it's initial movement diagonally, if it's player spawned it will move in the direction it was summoned, if player controlled they can only slightly ajust it's speed and angle, but it will not diverge from it's initial path untill it collides with a wall.) [speed = modcount tiles per second]
Massive Jump (3 frame jump off the top of the screen, for 1 second this mod takes movement control and can move at double the max speed durring this time, It will be able to move over any non-wall obsticle and land onto the enemy, if enemy controlled will miss 2/3 of the times OR enemy AI can only dictate this movement for the first half second, if summoned will miss 1/4 of the time, cool down should be considered on timing when programmed)
Burst Shot (Shoots [modcount]=[3,4,6,8,12] projectiles out in even directions from it's movement's closest cardinal direction so if moving movestly left it will start the first projectile aimed perfectly left) [the bursts are loaded when the cooldown passes, so when you already have 1 burst loaded, it doesnt have to be used, and the next 4 can still be loaded, 5 bursts can be loaded at one time, though if it's an enemy maybe add a delay for their desired attack time]
Meateor Swarm (modcount = meteors, spawn a bunch of meteors which falls from the sky, pre mark their landing possitions, and never spawn any ontop of the player, or in front of the player, summons will have a shorter delay on this attack and will have a random percent 20-100 of which meteors will be spawns on an enemy, player possesed will spawn 50% of meteors ontop of enemies every time, and only a 20% chance to spawn one on a enemy-PLAYER) [Isaac's crack the sky effect]
Regrowth (Max Health is devided into 2 health bars, one of which is 2/3 the health required to knock them to the floor, making them inactive, 1/3 of the health bar is used to dictate how many extra hits required to hit them before they get back up, when they get back up their "to get knocked down" health bar is fully restored, although their "knocked down to kill" health bar will never be reestablished, no matter the synergies) [insert tubthumping joke somewhere "i get knocked down!"]
Exploding corpses (Dead enemies will explode when their body disapears, explosion size relative to modcount, with a mod count of 1 you just need to hit the enemy 1 second before death to explode it, otherwise it wont explode, 5 mod count will give you a 5 second timer. enlarged creatures gives a +50% explosion radius per enlarge, calculated after initial radius calculation, each section of the enemy will also explode, so msnake creatures, and decapitated heads will both create their own explosions)
